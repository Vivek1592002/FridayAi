Hi [Friend], 

I hope you are doing well! I miss you so much and want to catch up soon! 

I know it has been a while since we last saw each other, and lately, I have been thinking about all the fond memories we made together. You have been an amazing friend, and I wanted to take this opportunity to remind you how special you are to me. 

I can’t wait to hear about what’s going on in your life. I have been keeping myself busy with a project involving artificial intelligence, and I can’t wait to share some of my experiences with you! 

Let’s make plans to hang out soon. 

Take care and hope to hear from you soon. 

Love, [Your name]
